# Getting Started on Heroku

Before we can do anything with Heroku, we need to do two things. First, we need to create an account with Heroku here and then we need to download the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) in order to run commands from the terminal that enable us to create a Heroku application and manage it.

After you create your account, install Heroku with Homebrew by running:

`brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku`

If you need alternate instructions for the download they can be found here. You can verify the download by typing which heroku.

# Deployment Configuration:
 * Installing Dependencies
    Deploying an application to Heroku is as simple as pushing that repository to Heroku, just like Github. Heroku does a lot of things behind the scenes for us when we push a repository - including installing dependencies. For a Python application, Heroku looks for a requirements.txt file that needs to include all of your dependencies.

    `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

 * Environment Configuration
    If you're following along in the project, use `touch setup.sh` and set up all of your environment variables in that file.

 * Gunicorn
    Gunicorn is a pure-Python HTTP server for WSGI applications. We'll be deploying our applications using the Gunicorn webserver.

    First, we need to install gunicorn using `pip install gunicorn`. Next `touch Procfile` to create the file.

    Procfile is exceedingly simple. It only needs to include one line to instruct Heroku correctly for us: `web: gunicorn app:app`. Just make sure your app is housed in app.py as it is in the sample project. Go ahead and make those updates to the sample project if you're following along.

# Database Manage & Migrations on Heroku
    In the data modeling course, you learned how to use migrations to manage your database schema and changes that you make to it. Heroku can run all your migrations to the database you have hosted on the platform, but in order to do so, your application needs to include a manage.py file.

    We'll need three new packages in the file. Run the following commands to install them:

    1. `pip install flask_script`
    2. `pip install flask_migrate`
    3. `pip install psycopg2-binary`

    Now we can run our local migrations using our manage.py file, to mirror how Heroku will run behind the scenes for us when we deploy our application:

    python manage.py db init
    python manage.py db migrate
    python manage.py db upgrade

    Those last commands are the essential process that Heroku will run to ensure your database is architected properly. We, however, won't need to run them again unless we're testing the app locally.
